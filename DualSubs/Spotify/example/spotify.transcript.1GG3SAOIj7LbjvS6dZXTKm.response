Better being better.
Welcome to this week's Bacon.

A mystery.
Bacon a murder episode.
QOK, listen, I actually had a completely different thing planned for this episode.
But this movie was everywhere.
CEverywhere I turned around, we were out in public in New York City.
9I see posters for this movie, I see an ad for this movie."…Ë¡
*I see Tik Tokers talking about this movie.
DThere was like a a thing where Teslas were recalled recently, right?
fAnd all the comments are like, leave the world behind, leave the world behind, leave the world behind.
eThis movie has been every single place that I've turned, and I just needed to know what it was about."Ï¯â„
6This movie is actually based on a novel by Rumen Alam.
"I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
!And here's the interesting thing.
5It's executive produced by Barack and Michelle Obama.
Yeah.
And it's kind of political.
It's kind of intense.
pAnd people are saying, are they trying to be little executive producers or are they trying to tell us something?"ÅËú¯
I don't know.
=Honestly, even after watching the movie, No thoughts in here.
That's the problem.
 I mean, I got a lot of thoughts.
sThis is one of the first movies that I've watched in a really long time where I could not make up my mind about it.
|And at first, when I was done watching it, I just took it as surface value and I was like, oh, I guess it's a good thriller."„®¶⁄
BBut then I saw these tik toks dissecting every part of this movie.
=People were scanning hidden QR codes that were in this movie.
DPeople were zooming in, finding all these Easter eggs in this movie.
It was absolutely unhinged.
rI think I need like a whole book club to have someone decipher this movie for me because I can't make I'm married."ï¿√å
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
+So with that being said, let's get started.
XSo the story starts with the Stanford family who quite literally embody their last name.
iLike when I say the Stanford family, I feel like you've got a picture of an American family in your mind."∑‡¡Æ
That's exactly this family.
Do you know what I'm saying?
yAll American family that does pretty well, but they still talk about how they're stressed out about work and budget cuts.
vBut like, you feel like they're not actually stressed out about it because they live in a brownstone in New York City."´ËΩ¢
)They also have this really blue ass room.
*It was like the first scene of this movie.
CApparently the color blue is somewhat symbolic later in this movie.
VSo, like, keep it in mind, but every surface of their master bedroom is freaking blue.
Blue walls, blue ceiling, blue.
Everything."Èÿ∑‡
8The family consists of parents Amanda and Clay Stanford.
WI'm going to give you my first impressions on them and like, don't hold me to this, OK?
`Because first impressions can change range, but from what I gather, Clay seems a lot more chill.
iHe seems very laid back, but almost kind of to the point of being useless Is like how laid back he seems."øê÷	∂
çLike he seems very He seems like the cool parent at surface value, but it just seems like he genuinely doesn't care about his kids that much.
*Like, maybe he does, but like, not really.
xAmanda gives me move to New York City from a small town and needs to prove herself is like crazy career woman type vibe."ÿÄ‰
œ
OI don't know, she just like has this whole monologue at the start of the movie.
She's bizarre.
-She's giving Manic Pixie Girl but in her 50s.
)She's played by Julia Roberts by the way.
	Love her.
ÜBut the opening scene is Clay waking up in the morning in this blue ass room and Amanda is already like making a ruckus in the closet."ı∏ÈÏ
She's packing.
Amanda.
What?
What are you doing?
Honey?
She's like, I'm leaving you.
No, I'm kidding.
#She's like, well, I couldn't sleep.
&And it's been a hell of a year for us.
+And I feel like all I do is work every day.
4And I don't even realize that that's what I'm doing.
MAnd at this point, she's like, aggressively stuffing clothes into a suitcase."ƒ¿Ùª
GAnd then you're constantly anxious from work and all these budget cuts.
BSo I booked us a beautiful house by the beach to go stay at today.
$It's on the water, and it was cheap.
NThis man is barely awake and he's finding out they're going on vacation today.
It's not our vlogs.
!Yeah, we're going to Korea today."ÒÿÛË
Hey, but you are Amanda.
OK.
Yeah.
=And then Clay is like, wait, wait, are you packing right now?
%Yeah, I thought I'd get a jump on it.
Wait, Amanda.
Honey, I don't understand.
When did you rent a house?
And what for today?"ç†ÚÑ
jI figured if I made the reservation and packed our bags, it would eliminate most of the reasons to say no.
She zips up the suitcase.
She's ready.
Clay's still in bed.
NThe details for the house you printed on your night stand next to your coffee.
ÜThe kids are still asleep, and I haven't started packing for them yet, but I think that they're going to be really excited about this."∆‡ÏΩ
Amanda's giving control, freak.
_She will want you to do something, but then she will do it instead before you get around to it.
wIt's 6:00 in the morning and she's already made weekend plans for every single person in the family, and she's packing.
0But Clay, he just kind of takes it like a champ.
He's giggling."Ω‡‰¥
He's shaking his head.
-It feels like he's used to Amanda doing this.
(OK, but Amanda, honey, help me out here.
I mean, why today?
#Well, Amanda suddenly gets serious.
She walks over to the window.
iWell, when I couldn't fall back asleep this morning, I came over here to the window to watch the sunrise."≤Ëí©
úAnd I saw all these people starting their day with such tenacity, such verve, all in an effort to make something of themselves, make something of our world.
%I felt so lucky to be a part of that.
aBut then I remembered what the world is actually like, and I came to a more accurate realization."œ∞¥∆
!She's like, literally doing this.
It's a monologue.
It's not a narration.
She's doing this.
"She turns her head to her husband.
(I came to the realization I hate people.
OK, so you are Amanda."âê∫Ä
So they move fast.
&The whole family is packed in the car.
Clay, the dad is driving.
8Amanda, the mom who is again, You know, be young, right?
mYou don't have to act your age or anything, but she's constantly giving, like Vampire Diaries Twilight vibes."§¯Øõ
ÅShe's staring out the window with her wired headphones in, talking on the phone, sunglasses, and she says leave the world behind.
4That's what it said on the rental listing, at least.
#She's on the phone with her friend.
Oh, East Hampton, right?
 No, no, it's a cute little town."ˆòÆÌ
(Actually, I think they call it a hamlet.
That's how cute it is.
FIt's a lot closer to the city and still very far from, well, everyone.
%The woman on the phone does not care.
9She just wants Amanda to answer some more work questions.
It seems like all Amanda does is work, but it's not like her husband and her kids even really want her attention to begin with."ñÄΩç
5So Clay is listening to music, windows down, driving.
He gives me stereotypical dad.
*He's wearing a Hawaiian shirt type of dad.
EThere are two kids, Archie, teenage boy and Rose, who just turned 13.
-They're in the back and Archie looks at Rose.
Did you just fart?"ûêΩï
)Archie, come on, let your sister be well.
$No, Dad, I don't care if she farted.
I care if she lies about it.
FMeanwhile, Rose just ignores her teenage brother does not even listen.
OK, she looks.
How?
How many boys and girls?
,One boy, Archie, and one girl Rose and rose."˛‡µı
Is 13.
Archie is older.
You're like 16.
Who's older?
Archie, Archie's like 16.
Rose is like 13.
OK yeah.
HAnd Archie is giving typical kind of like brainless teen boy type vibes.
9Rose seems a little bit more sophisticated, but she's 13."¡∞∏
She's the youngest.
She is an iPad kid though.
DShe has this giant iPad that's in like one of those padded silicone.
æThey're like the ones that they put on the kids, and she's watching friends on her iPad, and when it starts buffering mid ride, she's slamming her finger down trying to get it to play again."¨à∫£
ZAnd when it doesn't, she rips out her earbuds, crosses her arms and stares out the window.
RDad, when we get back to the city, can you take me to the coffee shop and friends?
!Honey, I don't think that's real.
It's just a set.
<Our girl Rose is now staring at the window, super depressed."ú‡∂ì
ÖBut keep this in mind because this Friends TV show is going to stick around for the entire movie, but you want to know something odd?
LSide note, Julia Roberts woman playing her mom was in an episode of Friends.
;So did she just not see her mom in that episode of Friends?"—¿∑»
oAnyway, our girl Rose is staring at the window Teenage angst at its finest and she reads the freeway exit sign.
UExit 76, Point Comfort exit lane only and we are welcomed into part one of the movie."á–≤˛
There's five parts.
PPart one, the house, the family pull up to this honestly California style house.
[I don't know what I was expecting, maybe some sort of cottage, but this house is giving LA.
It's a modern farmhouse.
I mean love the look honestly."óÔ∞é
NSoft oak, wood flooring, wood details on the walls, lots of sunlight, windows.
jIt's bright, clean, open concepts, writing glass doors, indoor, outdoor, living, perfectly manicured lawn.
PI sound like a realtor, but it is beautiful and it's very, very clean, you know?"‰®∂ €
sAnd I don't know if it's because it's a rental home or a vacation home, but there's like no character in the house.
ZAll the art, random sculptures of who knows what abstract ink, blot art is pretty, though.
;And the kids being kids, they're ready to jump in the pool.
KThey're busy and Amanda's already heading into town to grab some groceries."å¿ƒ!É
BSo, like, they're they're planning to stay here the whole weekend.
¶And just to give you an idea, the market that she's going to like, just to give you an idea of how small this town is, it's like Trader Joe's, but even more cottagey.
ìAnd we see something, and I don't know why Amanda thinks something weird about it, but me watching a thriller movie, I'm like, what does this mean?"–»ﬁ"«
[Amanda's loading the groceries into the back of her SUV, and there's this man, Kevin Bacon.
But he plays a man named Danny.
He is dressed in a Plaid shirt.
hHe's got this crazy beard he's hauling just like cases of water bottles and canned goods into his truck.
<He doesn't even smile when he makes eye contact with Amanda."Ï∏Ò#„
dHe just keeps loading water bottles and he's literally looking at her like, what are you looking at?
´When Amanda gets back, she makes no mention of the water bottle hoarding man because maybe he just likes to hoard water bottles or like he doesn't come to the store often.
%Maybe he's thinking too deep into it.
&Maybe she's thinking too deep into it."¿êÈ$∑
$Maybe I'm thinking too deep into it.
DSo she did feel like, oh, is he prepping for something type of vibe?
FYeah, she was like staring at him and he looks back at her like, what?
It was weird.
7So she tells Clay Honey, the Wi-Fi password is Novella.
9The owner must be one of those, like cyber security guys."áò˘%˛
Oh, I get it now.
I just got it.
Wait, I don't get it.
Oh, she said.
It's a novella.
dI thought she meant the password is novella, but she's saying the password is that long, so he must.
Be I didn't get it either.
 He must be a cyber security guy."û‡Ú&ï
I just got it too so.
}She puts a pack of cigarettes on the kitchen table where Clay is and her husband is like, They're not mine, they're not mine.
I swear they're not mine.
Relax.
I bought them.
JI know you like to sneak here and there, and I figured, we're on vacation."ÂÿÎ'‹
Why not?
I want you to have a good time.
*You know, just don't let the kids see you.
!Both Amanda and Clay are smiling.
/So it seems like they have a good relationship.
'And Amanda leans in to give him a kiss.
<But it's like the quickest Peck on the lips you'll ever see.
«And she keeps her eyes open the whole time, and she turns to walk away from him, But he tries to grab her arm and he pulls her in and he's like, oh, hey, you know, I got another idea for a good time."œ∏®)∆
)And Amandae whole smile completely drops.
She looks serious.
/She rips back her arm and just like, walks off.
So immediately.
Weird.
Weird.
They're weird.
#They're not a loving parent couple.
We don't know what they are.
They're cordial.
1They seem okay, but there's something to brew in.
Clay still calls after her."Î–¨*‚
ΩMaybe the whole family lather themselves up in sunscreen and they make their way to the beach and it's pretty quiet, but there's still like a few people lounging here and there in the sand.
üIt's not dead, but it's definitely not like busy season and the parents are setting up the spot, the blankets, the towels, chairs, umbrella, the whole 9 yards."∏ò∞+Ø
™Archie's texting his girlfriend, Taylor, but the minute, the minute a hot girl walks by, drooling, doing one 80s, breaking his neck just to watch her leave, OK, And Rose?
7She's the only one that seems to be more in the moment.
GArchie's texting his girlfriend, looking at any other girls in bikinis."ìêΩ,ä
I believe the dad is like.
ÅAlso on his phone, the mom, Amanda, is reading and Rose is just staring out into the ocean and there's a giant boat in the water.
(It looks like the size of a cruise ship.
*It's getting closer and the mom says what?
What is it, honey?"Ìê∫-‰
	The ship.
*And the dad says, Oh yeah, she's a beauty.
Looks like an oil tanker.
$Must be, must be a port around here.
jI read this piece in the Atlantic that says New York has one of the largest natural harbors on the planet.
MConversation over, like the family doesn't really like to talk to each other.
/Clay and Archie end up napping on their towels."∞∫.ß
~Amanda, the mom is reading on her stomach and you see Rose, who seems like she's in a trance, just staring out into the water.
You OK, Rosie?
,Mom, I think the ship is heading towards us.
What is that, sweetie?
She doesn't respond.
9Amanda looks up and the boat is practically on their lap."ƒÄ /ª
And it's not stopping.
It's not even honking.
8It's just quietly coming closer and closer to the shore.
8And for some natural selection reason, nobody is moving.
?They're all just like, yeah, I mean, it's going to stop, right?
TThey're all standing there with their hands on their hips like some Home Depot dads."€‡≈0“
\And Amanda, she immediately starts shaking her husband's like, like, wake up, wake up, Clay.
Clay.
He looks up.
Wow, It's getting close, huh?
You think that's a problem?
Nah.
Come on.
It's got to stop."òÿ√1è
It's got to.
Bro, what would you do?
Bro, I immediately move.
%When you saw it in the on the screen.
Oh, I immediately move.
You would have ran.
Yeah, I don't.
 Like, did it look that alarming?
He did.
I don't think I would have ran.
$I don't think I would have sprinted.
uI think I would have gradually, slowly grabbed all my things and walked away in time because I just even the anxiety."…à„2¿
Why would I?
I can't.
!It looks like it's gonna hit you.
It's head on to the shore.
OK, and the ball is huge.
&Have you seen a cruise ship in person?
*Have you ever stood next to a cruise ship?
Yeah.
But it's like oil tanker.
VSo it's probably even bigger like one of those shipping container type level of ships."Ê®Ê3›
/So it's like coming to them and there's nobody.
Is there other people?
Yeah.
>And they're all like, hands on their hips, Home Depots adding.
,Yeah, there's a lot of apparently symbolism.
I don't know.
&You can go down multiple rabbit holes.
(Some people say it's just a movie scene.
<Some people say, like, the ship's name is, like, white Lion."Œ‡·4≈
eAnd like, white Lion means ABC and D I'm not too intelligent to follow all these rabbit holes, right?
9But anyway, Clay is like, Nah, come on, it's got to stop.
It's got to, right?
6They look at each other and they're like, oh, hell no.
TThey wake up Archie, they grab a few of their things and they just start booking it."ì‡„5ä
LThey have to leave most of their stuff, but otherwise they were pretty safe.
FThey run to the other side of the shore and the ship ends up beaching.
@It ends up literally coming into the sand, throwing sand around.
"People are getting buried in sand.
Nobody dies."Ã®‚6√
WIt doesn't appear that anybody dies, but it was a shit show and it was it was weird it.
Was a ship show.
YThe boat didn't even make a single noise, though it didn't alert anyone, it just beached.
It was weird.
lAll the beach goers, they start heading out and the family see a police officer directing the truck traffic."ïò7å
*Like, come on, there's wait, there's wait.
EAnd the dad is like, excuse me, officer, do you know what's happened?
fThere's been a number of these groundings up on the coast, something to do with the navigation system.
Sorry, guys.
"I need you guys to keep it moving.
Come on, come on, come on.
And he just ushers them along.
ASo in the car, everyone is reacting to the situation differently."∫ËÅ9±
CThe two kids, they're watching YouTube videos of the ship beaching.
:They're like, Oh, my God, we just experienced that, right?
CAmanda, she's sitting there and she goes, wow, that was so strange.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Starbucks.
We should stop for some coffee.
+She literally name drops that company name."ÚÄ¸9È
/OK, Some people thought that was symbolic, too.
I don't know.
I don't know.
OK, Don't come at me.
I'm just retelling you a story.
I don't know anything.
Talk to the Obamas.
*You got questions, You got to e-mail them.
OK.
ÅSome people said it was very interesting, like, the way that people are reacting to news now, 'cause, like, that is something that might have been a topic of conversation for hours, if not days, if not weeks, like your party story for the rest of your life."Æ†±;•
DBut now we just all move on so quickly and we're like coffee, right?
So they get home.
+Clay's already prepping burgers for dinner.
\Amanda's trying to get on her laptop to read about what the hell just happened on the beach.
&But the Wi-Fi is down, the TV is down.
No devices are working."§Ë™<õ

Oh my God.
'Yesterday, none of our devices were we.
Stop it.
OK?
ÇNow the kids are back in the pool, and Amanda's just amazed that they're not fazed by almost being crushed by a boat on the beach.
PAnd before Amanda looks away from the kids, she sees near the bushes a few deer."π‡∑=∞
Clay.
Clay, Come here.
Look.
Oh, wow.
Deer.
That's a good omen.
MYou know, seeing deer, at least according to some mythology somewhere, right?
xThat night, the kids fall asleep early and the couple are playing Jenga on the dining table while they're getting drunk.
And here's what I'm picking up."Ö®ª>¸
*Clay has a job that he's passionate about.
He's a professor.
*But Amanda probably doesn't care about it.
She's the breadwinner.
FShe doesn't even seem to think that Clay's job is really that serious.
(Like, she it's the the dynamic is weird.
#She's refilling their wine glasses.
`And Clay says, hey, you remember that student of mine who was published last year, Maria Miller?"î‡œ?ã
No.
<Well, she wants me to write the foreword to her second book.
=I mean, you know, she says I'm some kind of huge inspiration.
WI never know if I'm getting through to these kids and then something like this happens.
Did you hear that?
There's like a soft noise."£∏—@ö
But Clay's like, what?
No.
ëHer second book is an exploration of how media serves as both an escape and a reflection, which is a contradiction that she manages to reconcile.
gYou know, let me tell you, Amanda is not listening to a single thing coming out of her husband's mouth."˙†€AÒ
 She is thinking about that Bonk.
And there it is again.
Someone's here.
What does that sound like?
Like like a thud.
\Yeah, Amanda's calm though, and she just looks at her husband and says get a bat, Get a bat.
A bat.
Yes, get a bat."ç∏ﬂBÑ
$Why do you think I would have a bat?
SAnd then knocking, knocking Clay gets up and grabs a thick cement piece of artwork.
2Some, I don't know, it was like a prong structure.
This is his bat, I guess.
I'm.
I'm sure it's nothing.
He goes to the front door."√¿÷C∫
Amanda goes to grab his phone.
AThere is a man in a white and black suit standing on their porch.
Like not even a suit, a tuxedo.
OHe looks like he just walked off AGQ cover or came back from some sort of gala.
:And next to him is a younger woman, probably his daughter.
'They look like father and daughter age."ù»‹Dî
And the man turns around.
!I'm so sorry to bother you, Clay.
Standing there alone.
Hello.
How can I help you?
I know it's late.
!A knock at the door way out here.
IWe couldn't decide if we should knock at the front door or the side door.
And this went on for some time."Â¿ﬂE‹
gI thought we should try the side door because it has glass and you'd have seen us and known we're just.
iAmanda shows up and she's got her cardigan wrapped around her like a freshly divorced suburban housewife.
Oh, you must be Amanda.
Amanda.
Stan.
]Amanda Sanford, Right, Clay's now like, why is this hot man in a tuxedo know my wife by name?"Ö»˛F¸
6He's looking at them insecure, looking at his pajamas.
\And he's like, you two know each other and he starts straightening out his posture a little.
You two know each other?
9No, we have not had the pleasure of meeting face to face.
I'm GHGH Scott."›˚G‘
7Amanda looks confused and the man's daughter speaks up.
George.
He's George.
"That's how it reads in his emails.
Oh, right, right.
Forgive me.
	I forgot.
≤See, This is why I much preferred the life before the Internet, because we would have spoken on the phone and you would have recognized my voice and known that this is our house."∆¯êIΩ

I'm sorry.
This is our house.
/I'm the George you emailed back and forth with.
No, I I remember the name.
I just.
This is your house.
BThe two stare at Amanda and Clay as if they did not just say that.
lOK, so to give you context, George and his daughter Ruth are black, and Amanda said it in a very racist way."è∞πJÜ
%It wasn't like, oh, why are you here?
I rented your house from you.
*But she was like, this is your house, you.
Think that.
You'll see it continues.
It continues.
It's not just one comment.
It continues.
1OK, Amanda was giving racist like she was giving."‹àªK”
DI don't even know if this could be categorized as a microaggression.
It was just aggressive.
They gracefully ignore it.
And George says, I'm sorry.
You think we could come inside?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sure.
	You sure?
Come on in.
Get out of the cold, you know.
Come on, Come on.
So Clay's nice.
Amanda's very skeptical."≠øL§
åThey enter and they pause in the foyer, and George says, I understand how strange this must be for you, US turning up like this unannounced.
We'd have called you, you see?
But the phones are out.
%Amanda pauses and looks at her phone.
3Yeah, my phone doesn't seem to have service either."ïÿ…Må
0Ruth, George's daughter, the owner of this home.
She smirks.
gIt's almost as if we're telling the truth because, like, you know, Amanda seems very skeptical of them.
bSo Ruth is like, it's almost like we're telling the truth of why we're here and this is our house."–ÿ∆N«

AAnd Clay says, honey, but I I wouldn't worry too much about them.
3You know, Archie would sleep through the atom bomb.
/You know, why don't we all go into the kitchen?
&Clay is ushering, Ruth and GH through.
?And Amanda is just following behind them slowly, watching them.
CGeorge is trying to break the tension and explain why they're here."ø–ÊQ∂
%We were at the Symphony in the Bronx.
Have you guys been?
2No, their productions are in a class of their own.

DSo in other words, I'm a very lucky daughter, kind of making a joke."‡ÓR◊
+Like, I don't wanna sit through this right.
KAnd Clay is trying to be interested, but Amanda is giving Karen which okay.
⁄So side note, I think Amanda's reaction is somewhat warranted in the sense that, like, if people show up saying they're the owners of my vacation home that I rented, I would also be highly skeptical of letting them in."ÌÿÛS‰
GHowever, the racist comments kind of debunk everything that she's done.
ôSo it's like a mixture of like, on one hand people are like, I get why she's skeptical, but on the other hand, you don't have to be skeptical and racist.
You could just be skeptical.
_So she's like Cardigan wrapped tightly around her, you know, arms crossed, lips tight and thin."¿òÇU∑
sEven when Ruth asks if she can get a glass of water for herself, Clay says yes, because technically, it's her home.

A blackout.
A blackout, Yes.

óA glance around and, yeah, most of the lights are still on, which is, you know, something you would think that our little Karen Amanda would point out.
1But instead she's watching Ruth staring her down."Ø¿ïW¶
URuth is grabbing a cup from the cabinet, and she knows exactly which cabinet to open.
3She walks over to the sink and fills it with water.

He doesn't know what to say.

These roads are familiar to me.

4Wait, you want to stay here, but we're staying here?

7George is very gentle, but Ruth is standing her ground.
>She's looking at them like because, you know, it is our house.
Which is valid, right?

hYou know, I've always had plenty of friends major in media studies, but I never even know what it means.
And you?
What is it that you do, Ruth?
Me.
EOh, I'm still figuring my shit out, trying not to rush into anything."÷®˘ûÃ
TThe last thing I want is to be sucked into a career that I regret 10 years from now.
{Which by that point I would be trapped by the pressure to stay on course because I'll be too old to re enter the workforce.
You know what I mean?
%George walks upstairs in that moment.
Morning.
Any news anyone?
Phones are still not working."π†ÚüØ
Looks like the TV's are out.
Where's Clay?
qHe went to the store to get newspaper or to try and find someone to talk to, to see if they know what's going on.
Smart.
<I thought I'd go over to the neighbor's house, The Huxley's.
GThey only live a few miles down the road and you think they'll be home?"“‡Ò†»
	Unlikely.
It is the offseason.
QYou often see no one here around this time, but I'll drive back anyway and check.
<Before you go, Dad, you might want to hear about the alerts.
Alerts.
,Well, I had alerts on my phone this morning.
]Two of them were about the blackout, and then there was one of them, and hackers were behind."Ò∏á¢Á
It was what it said.
Huh.
GWhat, you think there's going to be a meltdown at the power plant, too?
+George chuckles and kind of side eyes Ruth.
3And he smiles and says, is that what Ruth told you?
Among other horrifying things."ìò˛¢â
Yeah, that's what she told me.
5Well, obviously my Ruthie is being a little paranoid.
dDad, aren't you the one that always said that if you're not paranoid by now, it's probably too late.
:I'm sure this will turn out to be a big nothing like that.
Love you, bug."øÄ˛£µ
Is that coffee?
Can I have some?
5He turns to the coffee machine and Amanda's confused.
$I'm sorry, what is the love you bug?
)It was a computer worm back in the 2000s.
1People would get an e-mail with the subject line.
I love you.
HYou clicked on the attachment and it would send it all to your contacts."èàı§Ö
aIt crippled businesses because of a virus it implanted and caused billions of dollars in damages.
7Turns out it was just two teenagers in the Philippines.
"Could just be as innocent as that.
9Amanda smiles and says, I I think I'll go wake my son up.
áAnd once she's out of sight, we see George's smile kind of fall, and he stares at the drawer of the liquor cabinet with the gun inside."æ†°¶¥
Dad, I'm worried about Mom.
&You think her flight's going to be OK?
Sure.
?Matter of fact, I bet she's redirected to some airport in Ohio.
aAnd she's probably cussing out the every customer service Rep until they get her on a plane home.
<Dad, do you remember the time the three of us went to Italy?
Yes."¡–ùß∑
 And what made you think of that?
0I don't know what else to think about right now.
ÜSo meanwhile, Archie wakes up, the son wakes up, goes to the pool, and the two of them, they're hanging out by the pool, the two kids.
◊And you would think that Archie is the smarter one because of the age and the fact that Rose can't seem to talk about anything else but her show friends, which she's the one that keeps feeling like something is off."∆√®º
YArchie is busy trying to sneakily take pictures of Ruth's butt in her bikini at the pool.
Yeah.
"Who did mom say these people were?
Again, Rose doesn't respond.
What are you looking at, Rose?
%Archie, I saw something this morning.
OShe gets up and starts walking towards the bushes and Archie follows after her."º†œ©≤
Dear.
I saw dear.
"Yeah, they're everywhere, dumbass.
"They're like squirrels or pigeons.

Who cares?
No, this is different.
Archie.
+Like they were trying to tell us something.
%We should see what else is out there.
 Jeez, are you really that bored?
1Is this because you can't watch your stupid show?"∞—™¶
Rose won't even look at Archie.
)Instead, she announces in a creepy voice.

I'm going.
She steps forward into the bushes, and Archies follows after her because he probably has to take care of her and has no choice.
DAnd tell me how they're suddenly in a forest, like deep in a forest.
Okay."Ô…´Â
nThey can kind of see the big vacation house peeking out from the trees, but clearly it's a very secluded home.
Rose is on a mission.
åShe's walking in around and they see this like weird shed in the middle of the forest and it looks like a serial killer bunker a little bit.
MI mean, there are windows, so it's not that creepy, but it is a little weird."Ì–œ¨„
5They walk inside the shed and Archie is disappointed.
This place is so boring.
%It's just a bunch of gardening tools.
]Side note, there is a whole conversation about the outfit choices for these two in the scene.
âSo remember how I said Rose is wearing a NASA shirt, Archie is wearing an Obey shirt which is a street wear brand or like a skater brand."âÄÂ≠ˇ
8But the word is not lost on people because it says obey.
GThey both look around and Archie says oh maybe this is where he sleeps.
Who?
tWhoever made that impression And we pan over and it's a pile of leaves and like a human sized dent, not a bad setup."°∞ÊÆó
Whoever he is, look.
ÅAnd he's got a little window over here to look out of, so he can look directly at directly at what they both look out the window.

Your room.
#He can see straight into your room.
$Just imagine it's all dark out here.
$Your little bedside lamp is glowing."åê‚ØÇ
)He could just follow the light up to you.
Boom.
And Rose screams out.
!She bumps her head on the window.
That's not funny, Archie.
That really hurt.
He'll be fine.
No, I won't.
Dude, calm the down.
2As joke this morning I saw deer, Archie, not deer."ÿ∞Ô∞Œ
Like a ton of deer. 100 maybe.
"Maybe more, right in the backyard.
/Archie's looking at her like she's still crazy.
It was really weird.
7Archie, do deer just go around in big groups like that?
/What the fuck would I know anything about deer?
AIf you're so worried about it, why don't you just ask Mom or Dad?
Like they even care."«êˇ±Ω
&No one cares about what I have to say.
Yeah, that's probably true.
8Which, yeah, no one does care about what she has to say.
It's kind of sad.
®Meanwhile, Clay is driving into town to try and get some damn answers, and he's driving with his windows down this empty country Rd. literally just trees on both sides."¶–à≥ú
I have no idea where this is.
\Like they're saying it's close to the city, but then like, suddenly it's like the country's.
I have no idea.
"Geographically speaking, I'm lost.
aBut then, like, random shots show New York City in the skyline, so I'm like, where are we anyway?
ÑIt's so rural that there's not even a suburban Plaza Insight, and he's trying to fumble with the radio, but no stations are working."Ãêµ¥¬
NAnd he hears this like rumbling noise, as if an airplane is flying out nearby.
äAnd he keeps driving aimlessly with a cigarette out the window, enjoying his peace and quiet when he sees a woman on the side of the road.
/This is like a two lane Rd. in the countryside.
There's not people.
There's not even another car."‘ÿÆµ 
6This woman is frantically trying to get his attention.
#She's waving her arms side to side.
Help me.
Help me.
OHe slows down and stops on the side of the road and she's screaming in Spanish.
BSenor senor, senor, Honestly, she looks like she's seen some shit.
Her face is red.
0This does not appear to be a regular hitchhiker." ¯¨∂¿
ÜShe's frantically trying to talk to him in Spanish and she's very passionate about what she is saying and Clay is kind of creeped out.
ÖHe keeps trying to tell her I'm sorry I I don't speak Spanish, but the woman keeps frantically yelling and trying to motion with her.
-Her arms and Clay still can't understand her."‚ò∞∑ÿ
Do you know what she's saying?
No, do I speak?
0No, but sometimes they have subtitles, you know.
No, no.
åAnd I think with everything going on, the fact that they are the only ones on the road, with each frantic word, Clay is getting more scared.
[For some reason, the woman is now crying, gasping, screaming, and Clay can't do it anymore."—ËÀ∏«
IHe just goes, I'm so sorry, and he starts driving, He starts driving off.
&Leaving, she trying to get in the car.
No, she's like trying.
9She's like scared and trying to explain something to him.
Like, don't go there.
hMaybe, but he just starts driving off and the woman is like desperately trying to hold on to his window."ª∏‚π±
And she needs help, clearly.
But Clay does not care.
SSo he just starts slowly driving off, refusing to make eye contact with this woman.
áHe drives a little faster, faster, rolls up his window, and he just books it out of there, driving, and he can't even hear her and see.
òHe doesn't even want to look in the rearview mirror to see if she's following, but that buzzing noise in the background keeps getting louder and louder."æ®Ñª¥
DAnd then eventually, maybe like a mile or two away, The lady's gone.
HHe looks up and there is a giant plane on top of him, flying really low.
!But that's not the alarming part.
The plane is releasing some sort of red something red into the air, like chemtrail vibes, but it's like red smoke or something."–®ïº∆

Who knows?
Clay is not taking the chance.
àHe you turns it out of there, trying to make sure that his car doesn't get covered in red, because again, who really knows what this is?
tHe starts you turning, driving as fast as he can in the opposite direction, away from the plane, and he's screaming.
Oh, Shadow Shadow shit."Æ»òΩ§
7And the plane catches up and his car is covered in red.
NMeanwhile, back at home, George has driven to his neighbor's house by himself.
iAnd you know how he was just comforting his daughter that their mother was going to be OK and everything?
$He probably doesn't really think so.
áHe probably lied to her to calm her down, because when he's alone in his Bentley at his neighbor's house, he looks really stressed out."—¯¡æ«
ÖHe takes out his phone in front of his neighbor's house and texts Maya, his wife, but not a single text message is getting delivered.
"He has no updates on where she is.
0If she's OK, OK when she's coming home, nothing.
6George pulls up to the neighbor's house, the Huxley's.
&And the house is beautiful by the way.
ÜIt looks like a oh man, I wanna say like a 20,000 square foot Rhode Island Esque beach house near the water has its own private beach."∫êÛø∞
6But when George pulls up, the entire place is trashed.
Windows are broken into.
cThere's furniture outside the house, dog crates, suitcases just toppled over in the grass in front.
!Plotted plants have been smashed.
TIt looks like a hurricane went through this house, but that doesn't even make sense."—òÔ¿«
They're neighbors.
'How can a hurricane only hit one house?
öBut I think George was expecting that or something, because he brought his gun with him, which you don't casually do when you're just visiting a neighbor.
kHe slips it into his jacket pocket, gets out of the car, and he goes to the front door that's already open."“»ı¡»
He pushes it in and steps in.
Squish.
The floor of the house is wet.
Squish.
Squish.
Hello.
Anyone home?
It's GHI Let myself in.
Outside, the house was a mess.
Inside is even a bigger mess."©˜¬ü
eHe starts digging through the utility closet in the garage and he finds this black plastic briefcase.
 He pulls it out and opens it up.
,Inside is a giant phone, like a brick phone.
What are those?
Satellite phones?
#Do you know what I'm talking about?
JThat you would get if there's like, you need to connect to the satellites.
Uh huh.
HHe gets the phone out, extends the antenna, and steps into the driveway."ƒ†íƒ∫
But still no signal.
That's weird.
5So it's not even just the cellular networks are down.
&It seems like the satellites are down.
jAnyway, he leaves the driveway and goes to the backyard of the house and he looks frozen in fear or shock.
«I don't know, but for the first time we see how close this house is to the ocean and George looks up to see the seagulls going crazy and he starts walking faster and faster towards the private beach."ù∏Õ≈ì
uThere's trash everywhere on the beach and we can't really see much, but it does resemble the lawn of the Huxley home.
Like, there's trash everywhere.
6George looks down and there's half buried in the sand.
A watch.
It's really weird.
#Who just leaves their watch, right?"Æ‡≈∆§
Is this a Huxley watch?
<He bends down to pick it up, but it's attached to something.
PHe pulls it up out of the sand and outcomes A severed arm attached to the watch.
_George starts freaking out, falls back on the sand, and he's flat on his back, breathing heavy.
óWhen he turns to his other side and there is a man in a pilot's uniform dead laying next to him, eyes wide, it looks like his face is frozen in terror."“ÿ˙«»
(He So the arm is detached from the body.
Yeah, what's up?
He scrambles to get up.
Oh shit, oh shit.
äAnd he starts looking around and there's chairs everywhere, and on them are dead people buckled in as if they're they're ready for a ride.
QAnd he looks to the right and there's a giant plane that's on the beach, Crushed."ã°…Å
What?
Yeah.
Is it his wife?
7And then another plane is heading straight towards him.
"He turns and he starts bugging it.
ÇHe barely makes it into the Huxley house when the plane lands on the sand crashing and all of the windows burst with debris again."¥®≈ ™
EBut guess who hasn't gotten the message that the world is ending yet?
Amanda.
@She's too busy being a wine mom and committing microaggressions.
_She's drinking near the pool and Ruth is tanning next to her and says You going into the water?
No, you.
No, I don't think so.
Seems like a hassle."§Ä«Àö
Why?
&Because of your hair or what the heck?
Ruth gives her a what?
	The fork.
Did you just say?
EMore like I don't trust that one of your kids didn't pee in the pool.
\Which like, side note, kids being in the pool is like not really an aggressive thing to say.
Like your hair."åàæÃÇ
That comment is aggressive.
IBut Amanda, Amanda looks so disgusted and offended, Like Ruth is so rude.
She says they wouldn't do that.
%And yet we really can't know, can we?
Next to them is Rose's iPad.
2The screen is frozen during the scene of the show."Ñ†∏Õ˙
'Friends Your daughter watches the show.
(Friends Watch is far too weak of a word.
More like worships.
What?
^Don't get me wrong, I watched it too, but it's almost nostalgic for a time that never existed.
)You know, Amanda doesn't really say much."Å–æŒ˜
 She tries to change the subject.
0I hope the kids didn't wander too far from here.
And in come the Sanford kids.
ÅThey're walking out from the bushes and Archie stops A he looks down and there is a bug attached to his ankle, sucking his blood."•®∂œõ
8He reaches down and pulls it from his skin, throwing it.
(There's like mucus and blood everywhere.
#Meanwhile, Rose spots another deer.
Archie, will you please look?
What?
What are you talking about?
Archie, there's another deer.
.Look, when he finally looks, the deer is gone."ê¿∫–Ü
We should go there.
Follow the deer.
No, that I'm hungry.
Come on, let's go, Rose.
aHe starts walking off, and Rose looks up and there's like a flock of geese just flying over them.
Rose, I said, let's go.
1Rose snaps out of it and runs inside with Archie."øò∑—µ
=George has now come home, and he doesn't even look shaken up.
<He looks defeated, like there's no hope in anything anymore.
YHe's sitting there soaking wet in his suit, hands in his lap, staring at Ruth and Amanda.
 Ruth finally breaks the silence.
9So, Dad, are you going to tell us why you're soaking wet?"Õ»∏“√
I fell in the pool.
You fell in the pool?
I tripped over something.
Yeah, I fell in the pool.
"What were you doing near the pool?
$I thought you were looking for rich.
THoney, do you mind grabbing me a change of clothes and getting me something to wear?
?I'm afraid this is the only change of clothes I had downstairs." Ä»”¿
ZRuth doesn't want to go, but because she can tell her dad is lying, but she has no choice.
,So she leaves to grab him a pair of clothes.
5And Amanda is sitting there and George says I saw it.
You know what?
You saw what?
^A while ago, before all this happened, I looked at the market and I knew something was coming."πÄ‘‘Ø
What do you mean?
NIn my line of work, you have to understand the patterns that govern the world.
jYou have to learn how to read the curve, spend as long as I have doing it, it can help you see the future.
	It holds.
Study.
It promises harmony.
It inches up or down.
You know that means something."À‡‘’¡
$Cheech, why are you telling me this?
'Did your neighbor say something to you?
No.
He wasn't home.
5But he has a satellite phone I thought could help us.
I tried to use it.
It didn't work.
"Even though it had enough battery.
ZThe only reason why it wouldn't work is that our satellites got knocked out of Commission."Ω®›÷≥
Our satellites?
/You think something happened to our satellites?
<The ones in space satellites or network computers down here?
@So you think the hackers or whatever knocked out our satellites?
:Don't you think we're maybe getting a little carried away?
3I mean, maybe you just didn't use the phone, right?"ï∏‚◊ã
NI saw a plane nosedive out of the sky into the ocean, and it wasn't the first.
1We see Ruth hiding behind the wall, listening in.
VI no longer think this is just a couple of teenagers in the Philippines, Amanda sighs.
And then there's a rumble.
What the was that?"¯¯ÊÿÓ
It's like the house is shaking.
Earthquake.
	What the?
And then what?
2Sounds like bombs start going off in the distance.
GThe house rumbles again, and Amanda starts looking around for her kids.
Where are my kids?
ëAnd then there's this almost frequency high pitched noise that's literally so loud, probably emitting from all their devices and it's really bad."õ∏Ñ⁄ë
bEveryone, Amanda, George, Ruth, they all grab their heads to cover their ears, but it still hurts.
"They're literally wincing in pain.
CBut it's not just in the house, it's also outside in the woods too.
oArchie and Rose, they stop walking and they double over in pain as they're trying to hold their heads together.
QAnd side note, Archie has slower reflexes, so he listens to it a second too long."Áÿõ€›
)And then we enter into Part 3, the noise.
&Everyone's gathered back at the house.
Well, mine is clay.
I don't know where clay is, OK?
]And just to describe how bad the noise is, one of the windows of the house has a crack in it.
$It didn't break, but it has a crack.
They're all shaken up.
5And Archie says I should have covered my ears sooner."Ò¯£‹Á
Now my head feels weird.
ÆRuth tries to comfort him, and the kids are told to go upstairs while the rest of adults, including Ruth because she's an adult, they're going to think about what to do next.
BWhen the kids are finally upstairs, Amanda whips around to George.
+Since you're the one with the crystal ball.
What the hell was that?
Was that a bomb?"”êû›…

A missile.
2So they're just walking around holding their ears.
Well, the frequency stopped.

aThere's the blackout, and then you see planes crashing and George goes quiet and glances at Ruth.

	Who knew?
FAt the market, the town yesterday, there was a guy in the parking lot.

uI mean, I don't know what the back the rest of it says, but this part on the snake definitely means death to America.
3I remember it from a video game that I was playing.
They're all silent."˚¿ÙÌÒ
Nothing about this makes sense.
AIf they were attacking us, why would they advertise it like this?
5Death to America is where the Sanfords draw the line.
.Not the plane crash, but a red piece of paper.
I mean, I will give it to them.
It is creepy, right?
mBut the Sanfords immediately start packing up their bags and speed packing them into the car in the driveway."ÿ®ÙÓŒ
EThey're like, maybe this shit is only happening on the island, right?

So George.
3George, I mean, who wanted nothing to do with them?
!He feels like this is a bad idea.

$Whatever this may be, it's not good.
;And I don't think he can in good conscience let them leave."ÏòÛÔ‚

kBut the Sanfords are still getting in their car and George is trying to explain like it's not even English.
What's the point of this?
Like let's just stay.
There's no point.
But they don't care.
)They hop in their car and they drive off.
BThey're speeding away in their family van trying to stay positive."°òıó
CThey're going to go to their sister's house, who's not in the city.
LShe lives in Jersey, but they have to get through the city to get to Jersey.
ãAnd Amanda's saying if we hit traffic, at least we'll be able to talk to some people, see if anyone has any information on what's going on.
+It's crazy that we haven't seen anyone yet.
GClay is like, I'm sure we'll see someone as soon as we hit the highway."à¯ıÒ˛

ROr like the lane that leads into the freeway which is a small two way lane, right?"Í¿äÙ‡
WJust two lanes and in front of them it's jam packed bumper to bumper with white sedans.
&No lights on both sides of the street.
dI mean all white sedans trying to head out of the island into the city and it looks super congested.
Not even congested.

PShe walks closer and closer, and she realizes they're not all just white sedans.
1They're all white Tesla's, and they're all empty.

8It's a massive pile up of Tesla's, but nobody's driving."‰‡õ˜⁄

*George, I wouldn't be so hard on yourself.

,I mean, take your line of work, for example.
1Imaginary numbers moving around, imaginary money.

FAt its most basic, my work is always and has always been about people."ä¯ÉàÄ

êYou know, Amanda, some of my smartest clients have lost a lot of money because they base their choices on preconceived beliefs instead of truth.

#George starts getting very serious.
<One of my clients invited me and my wife to a private event.

Amanda looks kind of scared.

I suggest you try.
XYour neighbors, The Thorns, They did a basement conversion on the down low a while back.
No permits or nothing.
A buddy of mine worked on it.
#He wouldn't even show me the plans.
Now you asked me.
-That's rich asshole talk for Doomsday bunker.
Come on, Danny.
8You can't desert us like this, Danny continues, smiling."®∞™∫û
Haven't you been picking up?
"What's going on out there, George?
We've all been deserted.
DAll due respect, I would like all of you to get off my property now.
BGeorge steps forward and he pulls out his gun and he's putting it.
There's like a shotgun, a gun.
And Clay is screaming."üê°ªï
$What the fuck is going on right now?
3I promised this boy's mother I'd get him some help.
3The only thing you're helping him is a quick death.
Unless you lower your weapon.
GHGH, just put your gun down.
'We'll find another way to the hospital.
There is no other way, Clay."Í¯õº‡
!Besides, he's not gonna shoot us.
Danny cocks the shotgun.
#It sounds like he's gonna shoot us.
I'm telling you, he's bluffing.
The fuck I am.
7Clay jumps in and he's like, hold on, hold on, hold on.
ëAnd I guess it works, because the next scene we see Clay shaking out blue Oval pills into Archie's hand and Danny's sitting on his porch smiling."ò¯¿Ωé
HI guess an old fashioned barter system was to be expected at some point.
3Click like a barter system where you start trading.
Oh, what did they trade?
That's like Clay Whispers.
4It's still cash, so it's not really a barter system.
!He gave him $1000 for some Advil."§êœæö
What?
2Danny's now sitting on his porch, feeling relaxed.
3Hey, I got another tidbit for y'all free of charge.
What a plot twist.
What the hell?
All that for what?
I don't get it.
How did?
OK.
PDanny's like, hey, I got another tidbit for y'all free of charge if you want it."≈–‚øª
$It's the Koreans behind all of this.

Stephanie.
!Koreans, What makes you say that?
Just trust me.
Is the Koreans or the Chinese?
4One of them, George, looks like Clay, and Clay nods."Æ®È¿§
>He digs in his pocket and approaches Danny with the red paper.
I was driving around yesterday.
0There was a big drone dropping these everywhere.
It means death to America.
So we're thinking Iranians.
He says it like that.
Painfully American.
But it has a snake on there.
Right, Yeah."º∏ﬂ¡≤
And it's an Arabic I.
5Think it's like probably like Voldemort or something.
Yeah.
*And it's probably just like a teenage kid.
Like around.
OK.
KI remember hearing something on NPR once about Iranians cyber capabilities.
ODanny puts on his little reading glasses, and he looks at the paper and smirks."–¯„¬∆
What's so funny about that?
]Before the phones went out, I heard from a friend of mine in San Diego about a similar event.
BPlanes dropping pamphlets, except they were in Korean or Mandarin.
ÉLike I said, he couldn't tell which, but seeing as he did 4 tours in Iraq, he sure as shit would have known if it looked like this."≤à˝√®
He ends it back to Clay.
*We made a lot of enemies around the world.
+Maybe all this means few of them teamed up.
FGeorge's face of concern grows as if he just put two and two together.
kSo he gets back into the car and before he drives, he's just staring and Clay is like, GH, what's going on?"Á¯ä≈›
>Before we go, I need to know that you're on the level with me.
eNo matter how far this thing goes, I need to know that we're good because of what just happened here.
Is happening everywhere.
PWe need to get to that bunker Danny was telling us about at the Thorn residence.
What are you talking about?
+You know something at a sneaking suspicion."ﬁàã∆‘
But I wanted information first.
BAll the signs were there, sure, but I didn't want to scare anyone.
0You'd have called me crazy because it was crazy.
MIt would have made more sense if we were on the brink of an all out invasion.
	But this?
;I don't think we'd actually let something like this happen.
$I thought we were smarter than that."›¿ã«”
#What are you talking about, George?
What happened?
.My primary clients work in the defense sector.
OI spend a lot of time studying the cost benefit analysis of military campaigns.
FThere was one program in particular that terrified my client the most.
SA simple three stage maneuver that could topple a country's government from within."íêâ»à
The first stage, isolation.
AThe cyber attacks disable their communication and transportation.
xThen make the target as deaf, dumb, and paralyzed as possible, setting them up for the second stage, synchronized chaos.
´Terrorize them with covert attacks and misinformation overwhelming their defense capabilities, leaving their weapon systems vulnerable to extremists in their own military."É∞π…˘
IWithout a clear enemy or motive, people will start turning on each other.
=If done successfully, the third stage will happen on its own.
What's the third stage?
!Coup d'etat, civil war, collapse.
∞The program was considered the most cost effective way to destabilize a country, because if the target nation was dysfunctional enough, it would in essence do the work for you."ç»Ù É
dWhoever started this wants us to finish it, and George is rushing to the Thorn residence in the car.
RMeanwhile, the Thorn residence is this red brick house and the door is bright red.
GEverything looks normal except for So the Sanford's house was all blue."¿»˚À∂
=This house is all red, like the house is all red Brick house.
ÑThe door is bright red and like I said, every other house in this neighborhood so far it looked like that LA or that colonial style.
So it's like really red.
TAnd even the inside hallways are all red and the plaque on the door says the thorns."åê˙ÃÇ
£And inside we hear this aggressive crunching noise and we see Ruth sitting alone at the head of a fancy dinner table, eating snacks, just eating up all the snacks.
4She pauses, gets up, and enters the all red hallway.
$Not a wine red, not a pink, red red."ù®íŒì
4And at the end of the hall she sees this steel door.
-Hope begins in the dark is the sign it's got.
It's like a bank vault.
$She starts cranking it and it opens.
It's a 5 inch steel door.
RShe opens it up and turns on the switch Commode Survival shelters made in the USA."∑¯≤œ≠
=The dial clicks on, and it's like a whole new house in there.
ÎIt's a bunker, living room, pallets of those Big Blue water jugs, dining table, eight seats, a bowl of fresh pears and oranges in the middle, a kitchen stocked all the amenities, a generator, paper towels, pots, pans, bedrooms, a sink."Æ†ƒ–§
PAnd above it is a window that glitches for a second before a screen illuminates.
1And it's a rendered image of like a like outside.
-It's ATV screen that looks like it's outside.
nThere's plants, like ingrown plants for, you know, veggies and stuff like that, Mattresses with fluffy sheets."•∏»—õ
|There's a washer and dryer, a gym equipment, a fully rigged electrical system, a pantry that looks more like a Trader Joe's.
It's insane.
åThere's security monitors with a message on there that reads EMERGENCY ALERT White House in major cities under attack by rogue armed forces."µ‡¿“´
cElevated radiation levels detected by multiple population centers seek immediate shelter and roses.
]Standing in the middle of the bunker, it's beautiful and one entire wall is filled with DVDs.
‰There's a giant movie theater size screen and she goes and pulls one out and slides the DVADN and she sits down and clicks from the menu the last one and we hear the friends intro come on and she smiles as the screen goes black."¬êµ‘∏
OK, so Rose found it first.
:Yes, but it seems like all of them are going to get there.
"OK, so they're all going to, yeah.
Be sitting in there and.
Yeah.
>So there's a lot of different ways that people see this movie.
XSome people see it as just a movie, and they're like, OK, it wasn't like the best movie."ı¯Ø’Î
,And the ending was kind of like, Nah, right.
Some people see it like that.
TSome people see it as, like, the Obamas are warning us about what's about to happen.
áAnd then that didn't help because immediately after like, Teslas were recalled, there was like a software update that needed to happen.
<And then like a ship like docked or something, it was weird."ü®±÷ï
,So then people are like, see it's happening.
hAnd then there was a power outage in New York City right after this movie. 200 people's powers went out.
/But then people were like, see, it's happening.
+But then people were like, it's 205 people.
I mean, like, yeah, it sucks."Ω∏ß◊≥
'But like, it's 200 people will be fine.
And it's like a whole thing.
1So some people think this is what's gonna happen.
FAnd then you have a group of people that think it's already happening.
.Like, we're all already turning on each other.
NSo like, whoever's doing this, this is just like the dramatized version of it.
oLike we're already turning on each other, so and then we're all turning on each other and Rose, tinted glasses."‘‡—ÿ 
cSo Rose, her name is Rose and she just keeps looking for the escape like we all do on social media.
BLike just looking for an escape from what's going on in the world.
2And it's like the only thing that makes her happy.
Yeah.
dAnd then she is the one that is catching on to all these things like the deer, the boat, everything."π¯–ŸØ
&And she's like wearing the NASA shirt.
&Some people think that it's observant.
PSome people think like it's ahead of the curve and know something we don't know.
+And her brother was wearing the OBEY shirt.
›So it's like the contrast of the different types of people in the population, like some people who are constantly observant and the the people that are taking a back seat and just focus on their smaller scale life events."Ë†Ö€ﬁ
Why is there so many deers?
3Oh, migration patterns were disrupted by something.
Yeah.
CMaybe it's also symbolism, like nature will take over or something.
Mm hmm.
Yeah.
.I will say, you know, it was just, it's a lot."Ëòç‹ﬁ
Yeah, it's just a lot.
_I just think it's a fascinating, like I am not someone that takes movies that seriously, right?
I wish I could be a bit more conspiratorial, but I don't think I I think naturally I'm just not a conspiratorial person, right?
·However, I think this movie was so fun in the sense that you can really dig down so many different rabbit holes and you're going to find a group of people that are so passionate and they think something else about this movie."ë†„›á
CLike people either really hate it, they think it's going to happen.
"They think it's already happening.
YThere are a group of people that are literally digging down into every single Easter egg.
5Like there were hidden QR codes throughout the movie.
âThere are certain things that are said throughout the movie, like the red and the blue for the political colors People are hypothesizing."∂ÿËﬁ¨
Is that what that means?
òAnd then, like, one thing that I did read was like, in the end, it doesn't matter the political colors because, like, when the world ends, nobody cares.
ALike, you're going to be down in the bunkers with someone, Right?
2So, like, that was that could have been a message."·‡‰ﬂ◊
êSome people think the part where George is talking about how they always think that there's, like, a shadowy group of people that run the world.
But that's not true.
ePeople are like, is that the Obamas telling us there's no shadowy group of people that run the world?
EAnd, like, they also be stressing out like us, like, what's going on?"ÿêÊ‡Œ
Yeah.
FAnd people are wondering, like, do the, I mean, I should look into it?
0Do the Obamas executive produce a lot of movies?
-Why would they choose this one in particular?
õSome people were wondering it just because the Obamas don't seem like people who pick random movies, is what they said like to just like executive produce."•àÈ·õ
^They don't seem like the type to be like, oh, let me just like, pick a random book adaptation.
 Yeah, but it's very interesting.
6This movie is very fascinating. 1 Netizen pointed out.
Right.
WThat it doesn't matter where you stand politically, you will have a view of this movie."∏Ë‚Æ
rBecause so some people who think that the end of the world is near, they think this is a warning that it's coming.
∑But then the people that are adamant that the end of the world is not near, they think that the people that think the world of the the world is ending is getting played by this movie."ﬁË„‘
xLike, they're saying, like they're getting made fun of in this movie and don't even realize they're getting made fun of.
@But then the people are like, no, we're not getting made fun of.
@Like, you're dumb if you can't even open your eyes for a second.
"So it's like, it's so interesting.
*I've seen, like, literal fights on Reddit.
Wow."∂–Î‰¨
Yeah.
And I have no opinion.
äWhat I think my opinion on this is, it's just intriguing because I haven't seen a movie recently that has caused this much in person discourse that's passionate because usually it's like, oh, the movie's good, the movie is bad, you don't like the movie that I liked."˜∞ÁÂÌ
I'm mad.
XDoes this leave you with any lasting feelings about the world in the future or not much?
You're like, that's cool.
;Yeah, it makes me not want to go to New York City as often.
/I'm just kidding about the world in the future."ÆËÏÊ§
ûBecause you know like when I watch these end of the world type of movie like the movie don't look up that was a good one And then the even all of us are dead.
ÄThat show, remember, I was like, in my little world, I'm like, holy shit babe, this brings so much perspective and feelings and."™ÿâË†
àYeah, I liked the part where they all make up in the end and they all kind of come together because it gives you like, it's really grim.
íBut at least it's still hope that regardless of race, political affiliation, like when the world is ending, I guess humans are just humans, right?"†êûÈñ
òAnd we'll be hopefully in the bunker somewhere and around watching friends watching this video wondering, Damn, those were the good old days, wasn't it?
Now we're in a bunker.
What do we do?
Those are my thoughts.
What are your thoughts?
 Please leave it in the comments."z∏ñÍq
iLet me know what you guys thought about it and I hope you guys are joined and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
