# Mirrored

> ðŸªž **Script & module mirror â€” for personal use only**  
> A one-stop raw host that automatically syncs several outstanding open-source projects such as **BiliUniverse**, **DualSubs**, and **iRingo**, then exposes their assets in formats ready for **Surge / Loon / Stash / Egern / Quantumult X / Shadowrocket**.

---

## Why this repo exists

- **Centralised raw links** â€“ No more hunting around multiple domains; everything lives under a single `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../Mirrored` path.  
- **Automated upstream sync** â€“ `git submodule` + GitHub Actions pull the latest commits every day and rebuild combo files such as `All-in-One*.sgmodule`.  
- **Personal backup & learning** â€“ Meant purely for experimentation and archival. Long-term availability is *not* guaranteed, and commercial use is discouraged.
